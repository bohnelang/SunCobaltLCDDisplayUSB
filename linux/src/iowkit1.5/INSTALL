Installing the IOWarrior Linux SDK

Installation is a two step process :

1. Unpack and install the kernel-module driver for the IOWarrior.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because of major changes in the usb-core of the linux kernel>=2.6.20
The drivers code had to be updated in various places.
There are now two differnet versions of the driver package.

1a) If you are running a linux-kernel<=2.6.19 
    Unpack the kernel module driver sources iowarrior-module-2.6
    tar xzf iowarrior-module-2.6.tar.gz 
    'cd' into the newly created directory 'iowarrior-2.6'
    Follow the instructions in file './iowarrior-2.6/INSTALL' 

1b) If you are running a linux-kernel==2.6.20 
    Unpack the kernel module driver sources iowarrior-module-2.6.20
    tar xzf iowarrior-module-2.6.20.tar.gz 
    'cd' into the newly created directory 'iowarrior-2.6.20'
    Follow the instructions in file './iowarrior-2.6.20/INSTALL' 


2. Unpack and install the iowkit-library for the IOWarrior
----------------------------------------------------------
Unpack the iowkit library sources
	tar xzf libiowkit-1.5.0 
'cd' into directory 'libiowkit-1.5.0'
Follow the instructions in file './libiowkit-1.5.0/INSTALL'
