Simple install procedure
========================
  # Install the Iowkit-Library as already explained in file 'INSTALL'
  # and then ... [you need to be root to make this work!]
  % make java-install	#enable java-support

What 'make java-install' does to your machine
=============================================
The Iowkit-Library provides build-in support for Java because it already 
implements the JavaNativeInterface-requirements. The Java-side (i.e. the
definition of the native methods needed to access the library) is found in the
file 'java/codemercs.jar' which contains only a single class:
'com.codemercs.iow.IowKit' 

What needs to be done is:
1. Put the library 'libiowkit.so' into one of the directories that are defined
   in the System.property 'java.library.path' of your Java-Runtime.

2. Add the class 'com.codemercs.iow.IowKit' to the classpath that is searched
   by the Java-Runtime.

The problem with step 1 is: 
There is no easy way to find out which directories are set in the 
System.property 'java.library.path' without running the
JavaVirtualMachine. 
So this is exactly what we are doing: 'make java-install' will run a small 
java-app that reads the 'java.library.path' property form its own environment. 
Then it creates a symbolic link from the first entry found in the property, 
to the 'libiowkit.so'-file that was created when you called 'make install' 
in the basic installation of the Iowkit-Library.

There is similar situation for Step 2 (adding 'codemercs.jar' to the classpath
of the Java-Runtime): 
There are lots of different ways to add a class to the classpath of the JRE
but only one of them can be fairly easy automated. That is put the class (or
the jar-file in our case) into one of the directories mentioned in the
System.property 'java.ext.dirs'. So this is what we are doing. The same app
that created the link to the library, will copy the file 'codemercs.jar' into
the first entry of the 'java.ext.dirs' property. So the class
'com.codemercs.iow.IowKit' will automatically be in your classpath.

Testing java support
====================
After installing the IowKit-Library ('make install') and Java support ('make
java-install') cd' into the tests-directory and run 
'java -jar iowkit_test.jar'
from the commandline. 

If java-support is properly installed, the test will now print the current version
of the installed Java-IowKit-Library. Report all IOWarriors attached, blink their
LED's a little bit, Read the changes on the IO-Pins and exit.

Removing Java support
=====================
  # [you need to be root to make this work!]
  # To remove the java-support simply use ...	
  % make java-uninstall 

(Note: Removing java-support does not remove the IowKit-Library itself from
your system, use 'make uninstall' to do this!)

What 'make java-uninstall' does to your machine
===============================================
A small java-app will be lauchned, that recurses through all directories in
the System.property 'java.library.path', and deletes all files and/or
links-to-files that have the (exact) name 'libiowkit.so'. In a second step,
the app will recurse through all directories in the System.property
'java.ext.dirs' and delete all files and/or
links-to-files that have the (exact) name 'codemercs.jar'.
