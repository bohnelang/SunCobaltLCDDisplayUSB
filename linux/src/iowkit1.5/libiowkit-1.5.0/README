libiowkit.so is a dynamic library which implements a simple API for access of IO-Warrior devices
from Code Mercenaries (http://www.codemercs.com). The API is documented in doc/IO-WarriorLibrary.pdf.
The dynamic library also implements direct support for Java by implementing a class through JNI.

libiowkit.so depends on the driver iowarrior.ko.(see Driver directory) so you need to install the driver first.

For installation instructions for the library read INSTALL.
If you want to enable the java-support in the library read INSTALL_JAVA

If, for whatever reason, you need to rebuild the java-part of the library some hints are found in
'COMPILE_JAVA'
