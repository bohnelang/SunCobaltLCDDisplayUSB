Instructions on rebuilding the java-support in the iowkit-library.

NOTE : You don't have to do this ! Everything in the java-part of the library 
is already in place when you unpack the sources!
 
So there should be no need to rebuild anything in the java-support for the 
iowkit-lib, but if you really want to go for it, here are some hints.

You will need the following applications to be installed on your system:
ant - for controlling the build-process
javac - the compiler for the java-sources
javadoc - for rebuilding the documentation
javah - for building the iowkit-library stub

The easyest way is to go to the top-dir of the library and type
'ant rebuild' 
on the commandline. This will simply rebuild everything concerning the java-part
of the library.

Simply calling  
'ant'
without any commandline-parameters will print s short description of the other 
available build-targets.
