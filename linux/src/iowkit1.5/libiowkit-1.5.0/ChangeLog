	* build.xml the build-file for ant is now at the toplevel-directory.
	* added targets for building the java documentation in directory
	./doc/java/
	* added a task 'make scrdoc' that rebuilds the (C-)library-documentation
	in directory ./doc/html. doxygen must be installed if you want to do this.
	* configure.in /usr/lib and /usr/include are now the default
	installation directories. (KUbuntu did not find the iowkit-lib
	in /usr/local/lib).

	* src/iowkit.c : switched back to  
	'/dev/usb/iowarior' as the base-filename for the devices
		
2005-11-13 Eberhard Fahle 
	* INSTALL_JAVA : add some information for using the 
	'make java-(un)install' targets.
	
	* doc/IO-Warrior Library.pdf : renamed the file to
	IO-WarriorLibrary.pdf
	./configure choked on the Space-char in the original filename

	* doc/ : add a new directory to the distribution that contains
	additional documentation for the iowkit-lib
	
	* src/iowkit.c : commented out a few obsolete #include-statements
	//#include <asm/types.h>
	//#include <linux/input.h>
	//#include <linux/ioctl.h>

	* configure.in : add a switch to disable debug for compiling.
	compilation now removes the -g flag when 
	'./configure --enable-debug=no' is used. 
	
	* configure.in : set the -Wall flag for all compiling-targets

	* java/Makefile.am : add 2 more targets for java-support
	'make java-install' and  'make java-uninstall'
